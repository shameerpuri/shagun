It gives time to the couple to make up their minds about the wedding. Usually a couple of months prior to the wedding, the bride’s and the groom’s family get together at a common venue for this ceremony. The main highlight of the ceremony is the exchange of rings between the bride and the groom. The groom’s ring is procured by the bride’s family and vice versa. The engagement ring is essentially set in some precious metal like gold or platinum with a diamond stud or solitaire. Then the couple is blessed by the elderly members of the family with gifts like clothes, jewelry etc. Unlike earlier days, an engagement ceremony nowadays has attained more prominence by the sheer size and scale of the event. Large number of guests, decorated banquet halls, sumptuous food etc underscore the need for a professional management of this ceremony.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 277px;\">\n<p><img class=\"post__image--wide\" src=\"https://shameerpuri.github.io/shagun/media/posts/29/Engagement-Ceremony.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"466\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Thats where we come into the picture in planning out the whole event without you having to waste your precious time and taking the hassles of running from pillar to post in search of the best deals available to make the ceremony truly glorious. Be it the venue booking or the decorations therein (the engagement ceremony decorations are usually on a low note with soft lights and mild flowers serving the whole purpose) or the food catering and the other basic arrangements from music to photography. Be it an afternoon event or a late evening affair, we make it equally glorious.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
